# EndlessRunner
This is a submission for the intro to Unity seminar. The game is an endless runner aka a shitty SubwaySurfer. The Player moves forward infinetly and has to dogde  
obstacles by moving with the a and d keys and jumping with the space bar. Coins and a shield can also be collected. To increase performance objects and environment 
behind the player are deleted.
